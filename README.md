### Overall Findings

Based on the detailed insights provided in the text box, here are the key overall findings related to the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):

1. **Contribution of the USA:**
   - The United States of America contributed significantly to the overall COGS, making up 10.20% of the total COGS.

2. **Trend Analysis:**
   - There was a significant upward trend in the Sum of COGS, which increased by 168.06% between September 2013 and December 2014. This indicates a substantial rise in costs over the analyzed period.

3. **Mid-2014 Spike:**
   - A notable trend began in July 2014, where the Sum of COGS increased by 38.92% ($2,793,967.5) over a five-month period. This highlights a rapid rise in costs during the second half of 2014.

4. **Steepest Incline:**
   - The most significant increase occurred between July 2014 and December 2014. During this period, the Sum of COGS jumped from $7,179,054.5 to $9,973,022. This represents the steepest incline, indicating a critical period of cost escalation.

### Interpretation

- **Significant Growth in Costs:** The findings highlight a dramatic increase in COGS over the 15-month period, with particularly sharp rises in the latter half of 2014. This suggests that there may have been factors or events driving up costs significantly during this time.

- **Focus on the USA:** Given the USA's substantial contribution to the overall COGS, it may be worthwhile to further investigate what specific factors within this country are driving costs. This could include examining specific segments, market conditions, or operational changes.

- **Critical Period Analysis:** The rapid increase in costs starting from July 2014 warrants closer scrutiny. Understanding the underlying causes of this trend could provide insights into cost management and control.

### Actionable Insights

- **Cost Management Strategies:** Develop and implement strategies to manage and control costs, particularly focusing on the period of rapid increase identified.
- **Further Investigation:** Conduct a detailed analysis of the factors contributing to the rise in COGS in the USA and during the second half of 2014.
- **Segment-Specific Analysis:** Break down the data further to understand which segments within the USA and other countries are driving the highest costs and why.

These findings provide a comprehensive overview of the cost trends and highlight areas that require further analysis and action to optimize cost management.
